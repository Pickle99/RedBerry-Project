                You watch “What? Where? When?” Yeah. Our founders used to play
                it. That’s where they got a question about a famous American
                author and screenwriter Ray Bradbury. Albeit, our CEO Gaga
                Darsalia forgot the exact name and he answered Ray Redberry. And
                at that moment, a name for a yet to be born company was inspired
                - Redberry 😇
